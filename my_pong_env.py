MyPongEnv Class:

Description:
    This class implements a simplified Pong environment for reinforcement learning. The environment simulates
    a game where the agent controls one paddle, aiming to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle. The class
    provides methods for taking actions, updating the game state, and retrieving observations.

Purpose:
    - Reinforcement learning experiments in a custom Pong environment.
    - Agent interacts with the environment through actions: moving the paddle up or down.
    - Observations include ball and paddle positions for learning and decision-making.

Methods:
    - __init__(self): Initializes the CustomPongEnvironment instance.
    - init_pygame(self): Initializes the Pygame environment for visualization.
    - update_display(self): Updates the Pygame display based on the current game state.
    - step(self, action): Takes an action, returns new observation, reward, and done status.
    - reset(self): Resets game state to initial setup, returns initial observation.
    - take_action(self, action): Applies action to environment, calculates new state, reward, and done status.
    - update_paddle_position(self, action, is_opponent=False): Updates paddle position based on action.
    - update_ball_position(self): Updates ball position based on its current speed.
    - get_observation(self): Retrieves current observation (position of ball and paddles).
    - calculate_reward(self, done): Calculates reward based on game state.
    - round_reset(self): Resets game state at end of a round.
    - get_opponent_action(self): Determines opponent's action based on ball and paddle positions.
    - get_ball_position(self, plane): Retrieves position of the ball along specified plane (x or y).
    - get_your_paddle_position(self): Retrieves position of your paddle.
    - get_paddle_height(self): Retrieves height of the paddle.
